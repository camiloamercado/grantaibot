## What Is This Tool?

**Grant AI Alliance Master** is your internal AI compliance assistant. Think of it as a knowledgeable colleague who has read every grant manual, donor annex, SOP, and policy your organization uses — and can answer your questions instantly, 24/7.

**Key principle:** The AI only answers based on documents you upload. It will never guess or make up policies.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1 — Upload Your Documents
Click the **"Upload Manuals & Policies"** button in the left panel.

Upload any combination of:

| Document Type | What to Include |
|---|---|
| **Grants Manuals** | Your organization's main grants management manual |
| **Donor Annexes** | USAID, EU, UNHCR, ECHO, or other donor-specific conditions |
| **Finance Policies** | Eligible costs, procurement thresholds, financial controls |
| **SOPs** | Budget modification, disbursement, closeout, reporting SOPs |
| **Organigrams** | Org charts, authority matrices, approval hierarchies |
| **Compliance Guidelines** | Internal control frameworks, audit requirements |
| **Templates** | Budget templates, financial report formats |

> 💡 The more documents you upload, the more comprehensive the AI's answers become.

### Step 2 — Ask Your Question
Type your question in the chat box at the bottom. Be as specific as possible.

**Good questions:**
- *"What are the steps to process a budget modification under an EU grant?"*
- *"Who has authority to approve expenditures above $10,000?"*
- *"What documents do I need to submit with a financial report?"*
- *"Is international travel eligible under USAID funding?"*

**Use Quick Prompts** on the right panel for common questions — just click to auto-fill.

### Step 3 — Read the Structured Response
Every answer is structured into sections:

| Section | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| 🎯 **Purpose** | Why this process exists |
| 👤 **Responsible Roles** | Who is accountable |
| 📋 **Required Documents** | What paperwork you need |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can the AI access the internet or external databases?**
A: No. It only uses the documents you upload.

**Q: Are my uploaded documents saved permanently?**
A: No. Documents are held in browser memory only and are lost when you refresh or close the page. Re-upload each session.

**Q: Can I upload multiple files at once?**
A: Yes. Select multiple files in the upload dialog, or upload in batches.

**Q: The AI gave a wrong answer — what do I do?**
A: This can happen if the uploaded document doesn't cover the topic clearly. Always verify critical decisions with your Grants Manager. Report persistent issues to your IT team.

**Q: Can different staff members have their own document sets?**
A: Each browser session is independent. Each user can upload their own documents for their session.
